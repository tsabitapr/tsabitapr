# Hello Everyone! ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Tsabita Putri Ramadhany**.

## About Me
I am currently pursuing my degree in **Informatics Engineering** at [Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember](https://www.its.ac.id/), where I am honing my skills in software development, data analysis, and machine learning. I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems, and I'm always eager to learn new technologies and methodologies that can help me grow as a developer.
